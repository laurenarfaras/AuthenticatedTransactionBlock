How I approached the problem:
- I familiarized myself with the code. Then I created public keys and verified them in the
  terminal. After I saw how the problem was solved in the terminal, I recreated the solution in
  my code.
How I solved any challenges:
- Challenges I faced were limited resources for solving this problem using Java. I used the internet
  to help me face this challenge.
What I did to test the program:
- I created public keys and tested them with the signatures I created using the program.
What I learned from the assignment:
- How public keys can be used to verify the signature on a transaction.
